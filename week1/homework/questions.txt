extra credit: Read/skim chapter 3 of Microscope - Done


come prepared with 3 questions or discussion items (can be code related) about the reading and/or exercise

1) I really love that Sandi mentions the science behind the OOO design methods being discussed and for that
   reason and many others I wish I had found this book way back in March or so. POODR rocks! So much of what
   I have read on the Internet or heard from colleagues just seemed like opinion with no basis in scientific
   research, but now I see that there is solid evidence behind the ideas in the book.

2) This quote from the first chapter really resonated with me: "The syntax of the Ruby language is so gentle that anyone
   blessed with the ability to string thoughts into logical order can produce working
   applications. Programmers who know nothing about object-oriented design can be
   very successful in Ruby." - so true! I think I have spent more time trying to get up to speed on OO programming in
   general than learning the specifics of Ruby, because at first I was just putting together stuff in Ruby the same way
   I had in Pascal or even Bash.
   
3) My poor gem from the first class! My classes were certainly not single responsibility classes and many of them are just
   embarassingly huge. I have a lot of refactoring to do!
